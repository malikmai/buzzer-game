# Malik's Buzzer Game

HTML:

gameContainer - an ID that holds all the data for the game.

theBuzzer - an ID that holds the data for the "HIT ME!" button.

gameMessage - an ID that holds the message when the button is pressed.


CSS:

box-sizing - a global setting that affects how the dimensions of elements are calculated.

body - using light CSS and FlexBox to manipluate the button to dead-center of any screen.
    added extra CSS to the #gameContainer to make sure the text stays centered in the button. Also added some styling to the #theBuzzer to make the button resemble the "subscribe" button on YouTube.

JS:

added eventListeners for the clicking of the button so when pressed. A message is displayed to the user, signaling they have won a cookie... Not really though, cookies are currently out of budget. But the thought is nice (insert smiley face here).
